# README for Groq API Tutorials
This directory contains tutorials for using Groq API. If you're a new
user to Groq API, this is a great place to started!

## Installing Jupyter Lab

To use Jupyter Notebooks, be sure you've installed Jupyter Lab:

`pip install jupyter_client==7.3.4`

Note: If you have issues running Jupyter Lab, the following commands
may be helpful.

`find ~ -name jupyter-lab`

Output:
> /home/user/.local/bin/jupyter-lab

Either add the output of the command to your PATH or launch Jupyter Lab
using the path:

`/home/user/.local/bin/jupyter lab`

If you're remotely accessing your server, don't forget to setup your tunnel, where
server_ip is the IP address of your server.

`ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 server_ip`

## Tutorials

It is also recommended that you read the [Groq API Programming
Abstraction Guide](https://support.groq.com/#/downloads/groqapi-abstraction)
and the [Groq API Tutorial Guide](https://support.groq.com/#/downloads/groqapi-tutorial)
prior to using these tutorials.
